# I/O Streams
* Java I/O (*Input* and _Output_) is used to process the input and produce the output.
* Java uses the concept of stream to make I/O operation fast.
* The `java.io` package contains all the classes required for input and output operations.

##Streams
* A Stream is a sequence of data.
* In Java a stream is composed of bytes.
* It's called a stream because it is like a stream of water that continues to flow.

In Java, 3 streams are created for us automatically. All these streams are attached with console.

1. `System.out` : standard output stream.
2. `System.in`  : standard input stream.
3. `System.err` : standard error stream.
$~$

```java
int i = System.in.read(); // returns ASCII code of first character.
System.out.print((char)i); // will print the character.
```

###Byte Streams
* Treat the stream as a collection of bytes.
* Used when data that is input or output is to be treated as bytes.
* All byte streams are derived from either `InputStream` or `OutputStream`.

##Input and Output Streams
* An Input stream moves data from external source.
* An Output stream sends data to external target.
* All Streams behave in the same manner even if the actual physical devices are different.

###OutputStream Class
* OutputStream class is an abstract class.
* It is super class of all classes representing an output stream of bytes.
* An Output stream accepts output bytes and sends them to some sink.

####Useful methods of OutputStream
| Method                                          | Description                                                         |
| ----------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `public void write(int)throws IOException`      | is used to write a byte to the current output stream                |
| ------------------------------                  | ----------------------------------------------                      |
| `public void write(byte[]) throws IOException`  | is used to write an array of byte to the current output stream.     |
| ------------------------------                  | ----------------------------------------------                      |
| `public void flush() throws IOException`        | flushed the current output stream                                   |
| ------------------------------                  | ----------------------------------------------                      |
| `public void close() throws IOException`        | is used to close the current output stream.                         |


###InputStream Class
* `InputStream` class is an abstract class.
* It is the super class of all classes representing an input stream of bytes.
* `InputStream` subclasses include `FileInputStream`, `BufferedInputStream` and the `PushbackInputStream` etc.,

####Useful Methods in InputStream class

| Method                                          | Description                                                         |
| ----------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `public abstract int read() throws IOException` | reads the next byte of data from the InputStream. -1 at EOF         |
| ------------------------------                  | ----------------------------------------------                      |
| `public int availabe() throws IOException`      | returns an estimate of the number of bytes that can be read         |
| ------------------------------                  | ----------------------------------------------                      |
| `public void close() throws IOException`        | is used to close the current input stream                           |

* Java `InputStream`'s are used for reading byte based data

```java
InputStream inputstream = new FileInputStream(~/input.txt);
int data = inputstream.read();
while(data != -1) {
    //do something with the data
    data = inputstream.read();
}
inputstream.close();
```
$~$


###Character Streams
* Treat the streams as collection of characters.
* They use Unicode and therefore, can be internationalized.
* At the top of the hierarchy there are two `abstract` classes.\
    - `Reader`\
    - `Writer`

$~$

##BufferedReader class

```java
public class BufferedReader extends Reader
```
$~$

* It improves the performance by buffering characters so as to prove efficient\
  reading of characters.
* It is derived from the `Reader` class
* Buffer size may be specified using parameters to `constructor()` or default size may be used.\

```java
BufferedReader(Reader in)
BufferedReader(Reader in, int buffersize)
```

####Methods

`readLine()` method.

* it reads a line of text from the reader provided as parameter to constructor.\
  A line is considered to be determined by linefeed (ASCII code 10) or carriage\
  return (ASCII code 13) or by both.\

* returns `null` on end-of-file(EOF).\

####Example
```java
import java.io.*;

class LineRead {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        //Passing filename through command line argument
        FileReader fr = new FileReader(args[0]);
        BufferReader br = new BufferedReader(fr);
        String line;
        line = br.readLine();

        while(line! = null) {
            System.out.println(line);
            line = br.readLine();
        }
        br.close();
        fr.close();
    }
}
```
