# javap

javap is a command line tool that disassembles Java class files:
it takes apart our class files, and reveals what's inside.
The tool translates a binary format class file to human
readable code.

* As for what the `p` in `javap` stands for, all evidence points to
  `prints`, since the javap command prints out the bytecode within the class.
* A nice way in which we can `javap`, is to explore exceptions.
